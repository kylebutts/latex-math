# LaTeX Commands to Typeset Math

This repository contains commands to easily write mathematical expressions in LaTeX, and easily read them.

## Documentation

The commands are documented at https://pascalmichaillat.org/d3/.

## Overview

The commands are designed to make it easy to write math in LaTeX. They are also designed so the formulas in LaTeX look as much as possible like the formulas on paper. The following commands are included:

+ Brackets: parenthesis, square, curly, norm, absolute value
+ Accents: overline, underline, hat, tilde
+ Operators: log, exponential, max, min, trace, variance, covariance, correlation, standard deviation
+ Expectation
+ Probability
+ Derivatives: partial, total, elasticities, in text or display
+ Blackboard letters: R, N, Z, Q, C, I
+ Greek letters: most lowercase letters and key uppercase letters
+ Calligraphic letters: all uppercase letters

## Installation

+ Add `math.sty` to the folder with your LaTeX files
+ Insert `\usepackage{math}` in the preamble of your document
+ Use the commands defined in `math.sty` 
+ Existing math commands are not affected, so you can continue to use those too
